		<p class = "text_entry_2" "> <b class = "m">THE GOAL {</b><br/> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This comic hopes to spark an interest in computer science in our readers. This comic will provide easy to read and follow explanations of Pixel’s code so you can also hone your coding abilities! This comic as you’ve probably noticed, has the limited color scheme of various shades of pink and brown because the brown stands out among the pinks and emphasizes the fact that the main characters are all people of color. Historically pink has been viewed as feminine and stem fields have been viewed as masculine, this comic talks about stem with feminine colors and female characters in order to reinforce the fact that stem is not only for men. In current popular media, people of color are rarely shown as successful scientists involved in stem fields so we wanted to ultimately create media for people of color by people of color.
